# Active Context: CodeKit

## Current Work Focus

The current development focus is on establishing the core functionality of CodeKit, with particular emphasis on:

1. Repository interface and code extraction
2. Symbol extraction across multiple languages
3. Docstring indexing capabilities
4. Semantic search implementation
5. Context assembly mechanism

## Recent Changes

### Repository System

- Implemented core repository interface with local and remote repository support
- Added repository mapping functionality to understand code structure
- Integrated Tree-sitter for multilingual code parsing
- Created symbol extraction for supported languages

### Search Functionality

- Developed code searcher component with multiple search strategies
- Implemented vector-based semantic search capability
- Added docstring indexing and search functionality
- Created test suite for search components

### Context Generation

- Built context extractor for intelligent context assembly
- Implemented dependency analyzer to understand code relationships
- Added summarization capabilities for code understanding
- Created utilities for assembling context suitable for LLMs

## Active Decisions

### Performance vs. Accuracy Trade-offs

Currently evaluating the balance between:
- Detailed code analysis (higher accuracy, slower performance)
- Simplified analysis (faster performance, potential accuracy loss)

Decision pending based on benchmarking results with various repository sizes.

### API Design Considerations

Finalizing the public API design with considerations for:
- Ease of use for common scenarios
- Flexibility for advanced use cases
- Consistency across different components
- Forward compatibility for future enhancements

### Vector Database Selection

Evaluating options for the vector database backend:
- In-memory solutions for smaller repositories
- Disk-based solutions for larger repositories
- Potential for pluggable backends based on user needs

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. Complete multilingual symbol extraction for all supported languages
2. Optimize semantic search for improved relevance
3. Enhance context assembly for more coherent results
4. Increase test coverage, especially for edge cases
5. Improve documentation with more examples

### Short-term Goals

1. Performance optimization for large repositories
2. Enhanced dependency analysis
3. Improved summarization quality
4. Documentation enhancements
5. CLI improvements

### Longer-term Considerations

1. Adding support for additional languages
2. Creating specialized context assemblers for different AI models
3. Developing visualization tools for code relationships
4. Building integrations with popular development environments
5. Creating higher-level abstractions for common use cases

## Open Questions

1. How to effectively balance performance and accuracy in very large codebases?
2. What additional metadata about code would improve context quality?
3. How to best represent complex code relationships for AI consumption?
4. Which additional languages should be prioritized for support?
5. How to optimize memory usage for very large repositories?

## Current Blockers

1. Performance bottlenecks in Tree-sitter parsing for very large files
2. Semantic search quality improvements needed for certain languages
3. Context assembly optimization for reduced token usage
4. Documentation gaps in advanced usage scenarios
