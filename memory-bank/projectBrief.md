# Project Brief: CodeKit

## Overview

CodeKit is a Python library designed for code analysis, search, and context generation to enhance AI-powered code understanding. It focuses on providing developers with tools to extract, search, and contextualize code repositories.

## Core Requirements

- Process and analyze code repositories in multiple languages
- Provide semantic code search capabilities
- Generate contextualized summaries of code
- Index and search docstrings
- Extract code symbols and relationships
- Support AI context assembly

## Goals

- Enable developers to build AI tools with deep code understanding
- Support multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Ruby, Java, C)
- Facilitate efficient and relevant context retrieval for AI applications
- Provide high-quality code summaries for improved comprehension
- Create a flexible and extensible API for integrating with various tools and workflows

## Constraints

- Must be implemented in Python
- Must use uv native ONLY (no emoji usage ever)
- Performance requirements for handling large codebases
- Support for various source code languages
- Must follow strict code quality and documentation standards

## Success Criteria

- Accuracy of code search and retrieval
- Quality of code summaries
- Speed and resource efficiency
- Developer-friendly API
- Comprehensive documentation
- Robust test suite coverage
- Successful integration use cases
