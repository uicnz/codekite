## Current Status

### Repository and Symbol Extraction

- Core repository functionality is stable and well-tested
- Symbol extraction works reliably for all supported languages
- Repository mapping provides good structure understanding

### Search and Indexing

- Basic and semantic search functionality is operational
- Docstring indexing works effectively
- Performance optimizations needed for very large repositories

### Context and Summarization

- Basic summarization works for functions and classes
- Context extraction is functional but needs refinement
- Context assembly for LLMs is working but needs optimization

### Documentation and Testing

- Documentation covers core concepts and API
- Test coverage is good but needs expansion
- More examples needed for advanced use cases

## Known Issues

### Performance

- [ISSUE-002] Memory usage spikes during initial indexing
- [ISSUE-003] Vector search becomes slow with large number of files

### Accuracy

- [ISSUE-004] Semantic search occasionally misses relevant results
- [ISSUE-005] Symbol extraction fails on some complex language constructs
- [ISSUE-006] Summarization quality varies by language

### Usability

- [ISSUE-007] API complexity for advanced use cases
