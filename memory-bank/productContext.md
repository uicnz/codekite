# Product Context: CodeKit

## Why This Project Exists

CodeKit addresses the growing need for AI systems to understand and work with codebases effectively. As AI assistants and tools increasingly help with software development, they require deep, contextual understanding of code. CodeKit provides the infrastructure to extract, analyze, and contextualize code repositories to power these AI capabilities.

## Problems CodeKit Solves

### 1. Code Context Generation

- **Problem**: AI systems need relevant code context to provide accurate assistance
- **Solution**: CodeKit extracts and assembles context from repositories based on queries or specifications

### 2. Semantic Understanding Gaps

- **Problem**: Textual search of code often misses semantic relationships
- **Solution**: CodeKit provides semantic code search and relationship mapping

### 3. Documentation Discovery

- **Problem**: Finding relevant documentation in large codebases is challenging
- **Solution**: CodeKit indexes and makes docstrings searchable

### 4. Code Comprehension

- **Problem**: Understanding unfamiliar code requires significant cognitive effort
- **Solution**: CodeKit generates summaries to aid comprehension

### 5. AI Assistant Integration

- **Problem**: AI assistants need standardized ways to interact with code understanding tools
- **Solution**: CodeKit's MCP server provides a standardized protocol for AI tools to access code insights

## How CodeKit Works

### Core Components

1. **Repository API**: Interface for accessing and analyzing code repositories
2. **Code Searcher**: Find relevant code using various search techniques
3. **Docstring Indexer**: Extract, store, and search documentation
4. **Summarizer**: Generate concise code summaries
5. **Context Extractor**: Pull relevant context from code
6. **Dependency Analyzer**: Understand relationships between code components
7. **MCP Server**: Expose CodeKit capabilities via Model Context Protocol for AI assistants

### Workflow

1. Initialize with a repository (local or remote)
2. Index the repository contents
3. Use search, summarization, or context assembly as needed
4. Retrieve results formatted for immediate use

### MCP Integration Workflow

1. Start the MCP server with CodeKit capabilities
2. AI assistant connects to the server via supported transport protocol
3. AI discovers available tools and resources
4. AI invokes tools to open repositories, search code, or build context
5. AI accesses repository structure, summary, or docstrings via resources
6. AI uses the results to provide assistance to developers
