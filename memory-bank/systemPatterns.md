# System Patterns: CodeKit

## System Architecture

CodeKit follows a modular architecture where components are loosely coupled but highly cohesive. The design emphasizes flexibility, extensibility, and interoperability between components.

## Key Components

### Repository Interface

The foundation of the system that provides access to code repositories and their contents. It abstracts away the details of fetching, parsing, and managing code files.

- **Responsibilities**: Repository access, file management, repository indexing
- **Dependencies**: External version control systems
- **Consumers**: All other components

### Code Analysis Engine

Core analysis infrastructure that processes code syntax and semantics across multiple languages.

- **Responsibilities**: Parsing code, extracting symbols, determining relationships
- **Dependencies**: Tree-sitter, language-specific parsers
- **Consumers**: Searcher, Summarizer, Dependency Analyzer

### Indexing System

Responsible for extracting and indexing various types of information from codebases.

- **Responsibilities**: Docstring extraction, code structure indexing
- **Dependencies**: Repository Interface, Code Analysis Engine
- **Consumers**: Search components, Context Extractor

### Search Components

Collection of search mechanisms catering to different search approaches.

- **Types**: Semantic search, symbol search, docstring search
- **Dependencies**: Indexing System, Repository Interface
- **Consumers**: Context Assembler, Client API

### Summarization Engine

Generates concise summaries of code components at various granularities.

- **Responsibilities**: Code understanding, abstraction, summarization
- **Dependencies**: Code Analysis Engine, Repository Interface
- **Consumers**: Context Assembler, Client API

### Context Assembly

Intelligently assembles relevant code context based on specific queries or needs.

- **Responsibilities**: Context selection, formatting, organization
- **Dependencies**: Search Components, Summarization Engine, Dependency Analyzer
- **Consumers**: Client API

## Design Patterns Used

### Factory Pattern

Used for creating appropriate language-specific parsers and analyzers.

```python
# Conceptual example
class LanguageParserFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_parser(language):
        if language == "python":
            return PythonParser()
        elif language == "javascript":
            return JavaScriptParser()
        # etc.
```

### Strategy Pattern

Employed for different search strategies that can be selected at runtime.

```python
# Conceptual example
class SearchContext:
    def __init__(self, strategy):
        self._strategy = strategy

    def search(self, query, repository):
        return self._strategy.search(query, repository)
```

### Observer Pattern

Used for notifying components about changes in the repository.

```python
# Conceptual example
class RepositorySubject:
    def __init__(self):
        self._observers = []

    def notify(self, event):
        for observer in self._observers:
            observer.update(event)
```

### Repository Pattern

Core pattern for abstracting data access and manipulation.

### Adapter Pattern

Used to provide consistent interfaces across different version control systems.

```

## Data Flow

1. **Repository Initialization**: Client initializes repository
2. **Indexing**: System indexes code, docstrings, and symbols
3. **Query Processing**: Client queries are translated to appropriate search strategies
4. **Context Assembly**: Relevant code, summaries, and relationship data are assembled
5. **Response Delivery**: Formatted context is returned to the client

## Technical Decisions

### Tree-sitter for Code Parsing

Decision to use Tree-sitter for code parsing provides language-agnostic parsing capabilities with high performance and accuracy.

### Vector-based Semantic Search

Using vector embeddings for semantic code search enables understanding of code intent beyond textual similarity.

### Modular Design Philosophy

Designing components with clear boundaries and interfaces allows for:
- Replacing implementation details without affecting the whole system
- Using components independently or in combination
- Adding support for new languages incrementally
- Extending search or summarization capabilities without refactoring

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Error Handling

Consistent error handling approach across components:
- Specific exception types for different failure modes
- Graceful degradation when specific features fail
- Clear error messages for debugging

### Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading of components when possible
- Caching of parsed code and intermediate results
- Parallelization of independent operations
- Configurable trade-offs between performance and accuracy

### Extensibility Points

- Language support extension via Tree-sitter grammar plugins
- Custom search strategy implementation
- Summary generation customization
- Repository adapter extension
