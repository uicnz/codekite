:::note
These snippets are *copy-paste-ready* solutions for common developer-productivity tasks with **kit**. Adapt them to scripts, CI jobs, or IDE plugins.
:::

## 1. Rename every function `old_name` → `new_name`

```python
from pathlib import Path
from kit import Repository

repo = Repository("/path/to/project")

# Gather definitions & references (quick heuristic)
usages = repo.find_symbol_usages("old_name", symbol_type="function")

edits: dict[str, str] = {}
for u in usages:
    path, line = u["file"], u.get("line")
    if line is None:
        continue
    lines = repo.get_file_content(path).splitlines()
    lines[line] = lines[line].replace("old_name", "new_name")
    edits[path] = "\n".join(lines) + "\n"

# Apply edits – prompt the user first!
for rel_path, new_src in edits.items():
    Path(repo.repo_path, rel_path).write_text(new_src)

repo.mapper.scan_repo()  # refresh symbols if you’ll run more queries
```

---

## 2. Summarize a Git diff for an LLM PR review

```python
from kit import Repository
repo = Repository(".")
assembler = repo.get_context_assembler()
assembler.add_diff(diff_text)  # diff_text from `git diff`
summary = repo.get_summarizer().summarize(assembler.format_context())
print(summary)
```

---

## 3. Semantic search for authentication code

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
embed = lambda text: model.encode([text])[0].tolist()

repo = Repository(".")
vs = repo.get_vector_searcher(embed_fn=embed)
vs.build_index()

hits = repo.search_semantic("How is user authentication handled?", embed_fn=embed)
for h in hits:
    print(h["file"], h.get("name"))
```

---

## 4. Export full repo index to JSON (file tree + symbols)

```python
repo = Repository("/path/to/project")
repo.write_index("repo_index.json")
```

---

## 5. Find All Callers of a Specific Function (Cross-File)

This recipe helps you understand where a particular function is being used throughout your entire codebase, which is crucial for impact analysis or refactoring.

```python
from kit import Repository

# Initialize the repository
repo = Repository("/path/to/your_project")

# Specify the function name and its type
function_name_to_trace = "my_target_function"

# Find all usages (definitions, calls, imports)
usages = repo.find_symbol_usages(function_name_to_trace, symbol_type="function")

print(f"Usages of function '{function_name_to_trace}':")
for usage in usages:
    file_path = usage.get("file")
    line_number = usage.get("line") # Assuming 'line' is the start line of the usage/symbol
    context_snippet = usage.get("context", "No context available")
    usage_type = usage.get("type", "unknown") # e.g., 'function' for definition, 'call' for a call site

    # We are interested in where it's CALLED, so we might filter out the definition itself if needed,
    # or differentiate based on the 'type' or 'context'.
    # For this example, we'll print all usages.
    if line_number is not None:
        print(f"- Found in: {file_path}:L{line_number + 1}") # (line is 0-indexed, display as 1-indexed)
    else:
        print(f"- Found in: {file_path}")
    print(f"    Type: {usage_type}")
    print(f"    Context: {context_snippet.strip()}\n")

# Example: Filtering for actual call sites (heuristic based on context or type if available)
# print(f"\nCall sites for function '{function_name_to_trace}':")
# for usage in usages:
#     # This condition might need refinement based on what 'find_symbol_usages' returns for 'type' of a call
#     if usage.get("type") != "function" and function_name_to_trace + "(" in usage.get("context", ""):
#         file_path = usage.get("file")
#         line_number = usage.get("line")
#         print(f"- Call in: {file_path}:L{line_number + 1 if line_number is not None else 'N/A'}")

```

## 6. Identify Potentially Unused Functions (Heuristic)

This recipe provides a heuristic to find functions that *might* be unused within the analyzed codebase. This can be a starting point for identifying dead code. Note that this is a heuristic because it might not catch dynamically called functions, functions part of a public API but not used internally, or functions used only in parts of the codebase not analyzed (e.g., separate test suites).

```python
from kit import Repository

repo = Repository("/path/to/your_project")

# Get all symbols from the repository index
# The structure of repo.index() might vary; assuming it's a dict like {'symbols': {'file_path': [symbol_dicts]}}
# or a direct way to get all function definitions.
# For this example, let's assume we can iterate through all symbols and filter functions.

# A more robust way might be to iterate files, then symbols within files from repo.index()
# index = repo.index()
# all_symbols_by_file = index.get("symbols", {})

print("Potentially unused functions:")

# First, get a list of all function definitions
defined_functions = []
repo_index = repo.index() # Assuming this fetches file tree and symbols
symbols_map = repo_index.get("symbols", {})

for file_path, symbols_in_file in symbols_map.items():
    for symbol_info in symbols_in_file:
        if symbol_info.get("type") == "function":
            defined_functions.append({
                "name": symbol_info.get("name"),
                "file": file_path,
                "line": symbol_info.get("line_start", 0) # or 'line'
            })

for func_def in defined_functions:
    function_name = func_def["name"]
    definition_file = func_def["file"]
    definition_line = func_def["line"]

    if not function_name: # Skip if name is missing
        continue

    usages = repo.find_symbol_usages(function_name, symbol_type="function")

    # Filter out the definition itself from the usages to count actual calls/references
    # This heuristic assumes a usage is NOT the definition if its file and line differ,
    # or if the usage 'type' (if available and detailed) indicates a call.
    # A simpler heuristic: if only 1 usage, it's likely just the definition.
    
    actual_references = []
    for u in usages:
        # Check if the usage is different from the definition site
        if not (u.get("file") == definition_file and u.get("line") == definition_line):
            actual_references.append(u)
    
    # If a function has no other references apart from its own definition site (or very few)
    # It's a candidate for being unused. The threshold (e.g., 0 or 1) can be adjusted.
    if len(actual_references) == 0:
        print(f"- Function '{function_name}' defined in {definition_file}:L{definition_line + 1} has no apparent internal usages.")

:::caution[Limitations of this heuristic:]
**Limitations of this heuristic:**

*   **Dynamic Calls:** Functions called dynamically (e.g., through reflection, or if the function name is constructed from a string at runtime) won't be detected as used.
*   **Public APIs:** Functions intended for external use (e.g., library functions) will appear unused if the analysis is limited to the library's own codebase.
*   **Test Code:** If your test suite is separate and not part of the `Repository` path being analyzed, functions used only by tests might be flagged.
*   **Object Methods:** The `symbol_type="function"` might need adjustment or further logic if you are also looking for unused *methods* within classes, as their usage context is different.
