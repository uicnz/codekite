title: Codebase Summarizer
---

This tutorial shows how to use `kit` to generate a structured Markdown summary of your codebase, including the file tree and all extracted symbols (functions, classes, etc.). Such a summary can be invaluable for quickly understanding a new project, tracking architectural changes, or for documentation purposes.

## Step 1: Summarize the Codebase Structure

The core of this task lies in using `kit`'s `Repository` object to analyze the codebase and extract its structural information. This process involves two main `kit` operations:

1.  **Initializing the `Repository`**: `repo = Repo(repo_path)` creates an instance that points `kit` to the target codebase. `kit` then becomes aware of the repository's location and is ready to perform various analyses.
2.  **Indexing the Repository**: `index = repo.index()` is a key `kit` command. When called, `kit` (typically using its internal `RepoMapper` component) traverses the repository, parses supported source files, identifies structural elements like files, directories, classes, functions, and other symbols. It then compiles this information into a structured `index`.

Use kit's `Repo` object to index the codebase and gather all relevant information.

```python
from kit import Repo

def summarize_codebase(repo_path: str) -> str:
    repo = Repo(repo_path)
    index = repo.index()
    lines = [f"# Codebase Summary for {repo_path}\n"]
    lines.append("## File Tree\n")
    # The index['file_tree'] contains a list of file and directory paths
    for file_info in index["file_tree"]:
        # Assuming file_info is a dictionary or string representing the path
        # Adjust formatting based on the actual structure of file_info objects from repo.index()
        if isinstance(file_info, dict):
            lines.append(f"- {file_info.get('path', file_info.get('name', 'Unknown file/dir'))}")
        else:
            lines.append(f"- {file_info}") # Fallback if it's just a string path

    lines.append("\n## Symbols\n")
    # The index['symbols'] is typically a dictionary where keys are file paths
    # and values are lists of symbol information dictionaries for that file.
    for file_path, symbols_in_file in index["symbols"].items():
        lines.append(f"### {file_path}")
        for symbol in symbols_in_file:
            # Each symbol dict contains details like 'type' (e.g., 'function', 'class') and 'name'.
            lines.append(f"- **{symbol['type']}** `{symbol['name']}`")
        lines.append("")
    return "\n".join(lines)
```

This function, `summarize_codebase`, first initializes `kit` for the given `repo_path`. Then, `repo.index()` does the heavy lifting of analyzing the code. The resulting `index` object is a dictionary, typically containing at least two keys:

*   `'file_tree'`: A list representing the directory structure and files within the repository.
*   `'symbols'`: A dictionary where keys are file paths, and each value is a list of symbols found in that file. Each symbol is itself a dictionary containing details like its name and type (e.g., function, class).

The rest of the function iterates through this structured data to format it into a human-readable Markdown string.

## Step 2: Command-Line Interface

To make the summarizer easy to use from the terminal, we'll add a simple command-line interface using Python's `argparse` module. This allows the user to specify the repository path and an optional output file for the summary.

Provide CLI arguments for repo path and output file:

```python
import argparse

def main() -> None:
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Codebase summarizer using kit.")
    parser.add_argument("--repo", required=True, help="Path to the code repository")
    parser.add_argument("--output", help="Output Markdown file (default: stdout)")
    args = parser.parse_args()
    summary = summarize_codebase(args.repo)
    if args.output:
        with open(args.output, "w") as f:
            f.write(summary)
        print(f"Summary written to {args.output}")
    else:
        print(summary)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Step 3: Running the Script

With the script in place, you can execute it from your terminal. You'll need to provide the path to the repository you want to summarize and, optionally, a path where the Markdown output file should be saved. If no output file is specified, the summary will be printed to the console.

Run the summarizer like this:

```sh
python codebase_summarizer.py --repo /path/to/repo --output summary.md
```

---

## Example Output

The generated Markdown file (or console output) will provide a clear, structured overview of your project, derived directly from `kit`'s analysis. It will list the files and then, for each file, the symbols defined within it.

```
# Codebase Summary for /path/to/repo

## File Tree
- main.py
- utils.py
- models/
- models/model.py

## Symbols
### main.py
- **function** `main`
- **class** `App`

### utils.py
- **function** `helper`
```

---

## Customization Ideas

The basic summarizer can be extended in many ways, leveraging more of `kit`'s potential or other Python libraries:

*   **Add code metrics**: `kit`'s `RepoMapper` might provide (or be extended to provide) metrics like lines of code or complexity for files/symbols.
*   **Include docstrings or comments**: The symbol information from `repo.index()` can be augmented to include extracted docstrings or important comments associated with each symbol.
*   **Output in other formats**: Instead of Markdown, you could use libraries to format the `index` data as HTML, CSV, JSON, or any other structured format.
*   **Integrate with CI**: Run this script as part of your Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to automatically update the codebase summary whenever changes are pushed.
