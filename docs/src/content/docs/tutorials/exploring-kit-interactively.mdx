title: Exploring Kit Interactively with the Python Shell
description: A hands-on guide to trying out Kit's features directly in a Python interpreter.
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This guide walks you through interactively exploring the `kit` library's capabilities using a Python shell. This is a great way to quickly understand how different components work, test out methods, and see the structure of the data they return.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1.  Cloned the `kit` repository.
2.  Set up your Python environment and installed `kit`'s dependencies. Ideally, you've installed `kit` in editable mode if you're also making changes:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
3.  (Optional but recommended) Familiarized yourself with the [Core Concepts](/core-concepts/introduction) of `kit`.

## Getting Started: Your First Exploration

Let's dive in! We'll start by instantiating the `Repository` class and trying out some of its basic methods.

<Steps>

1.  **Launch your Python Interpreter**

    Open your terminal and start Python:
    ```bash
    python
    # or python3
    ```

2.  **Import `Repository` and Initialize**

    The `Repository` class is your main entry point for interacting with a codebase.

    ```python
    from kit.repository import Repository
    import os # We'll use this for path joining

    # Replace with the absolute path to your local clone of the 'kit' repository (or any other repo)
    # For example, if you are in the root of the 'kit' repo itself:
    repo_path = os.path.abspath(".") 
    # Or provide a full path directly:
    # repo_path = "/path/to/your/repository"

    repo = Repository(repo_path)
    print(repo) 
    # This should print something like: <Repository path=/path/to/your/repository, branch=main, files=XX>
    ```
    This confirms your `Repository` object is ready.

</Steps>

## Extracting Symbols from a File

One of the core features of `kit` is its ability to parse source code and extract meaningful symbols like classes, functions, and methods. The `repo.extract_symbols()` method is used for this. After recent updates, this method now provides the full source code for each symbol and the correct line numbers spanning the entire symbol definition.

<Steps>

1.  **Choose a File and Extract Symbols**

    Let's try extracting symbols from the `src/kit/repository.py` file itself.

    ```python
    # Assuming 'repo' is your Repository instance from the previous step
    # and 'os' is imported.

    file_to_test_relative = "src/kit/repository.py"
    full_file_path = os.path.join(repo.repo_path, file_to_test_relative)

    print(f"Extracting symbols from: {full_file_path}")
    symbols_in_repo_py = repo.extract_symbols(full_file_path)

    # You can use pprint for a more readable output of complex objects
    import pprint 
    # pprint.pprint(symbols_in_repo_py) # Uncomment to see all symbols
    ```

2.  **Inspect a Specific Symbol**

    Let's look at the first symbol extracted, which should be the `Repository` class itself.

    ```python
    if symbols_in_repo_py:
        repository_class_symbol = None
        for sym in symbols_in_repo_py:
            if sym.get('name') == 'Repository' and sym.get('type') == 'class':
                repository_class_symbol = sym
                break
        
        if repository_class_symbol:
            print("\n--- Details for 'Repository' class symbol ---")
            print(f"Name: {repository_class_symbol.get('name')}")
            print(f"Type: {repository_class_symbol.get('type')}")
            print(f"Start Line: {repository_class_symbol.get('start_line')}")
            print(f"End Line: {repository_class_symbol.get('end_line')}")
            print(f"File: {repository_class_symbol.get('file')}") # Though we know the file, it's good to see it in the output
            print("\nCode (first ~300 characters):")
            print(repository_class_symbol.get('code', '')[:300] + "...")
            print(f"\n(Full code length: {len(repository_class_symbol.get('code', ''))} characters)")
            print("------")
        else:
            print("Could not find the 'Repository' class symbol.")
    else:
        print(f"No symbols extracted from {file_to_test_relative}")
    ```

    You should see that:
    *   The `code` field contains the *entire* source code of the `Repository` class.
    *   `start_line` and `end_line` accurately reflect the beginning and end of the class definition.
    *   This is a significant improvement, providing much richer data for analysis or use in LLM prompts.

</Steps>

## Listing All Files in the Repository

To get an overview of all files and directories that `kit` recognizes within your repository, you can use the `repo.get_file_tree()` method. This is helpful for understanding the scope of what `kit` will operate on.

<Steps>

1.  **Call `get_file_tree()`**

    ```python
    # Assuming 'repo' is your Repository instance

    print("\n--- Getting File Tree ---")
    file_tree = repo.get_file_tree()

    if file_tree:
        print(f"Found {len(file_tree)} files/items in the repository.")
        print("\nFirst 5 items in the file tree:")
        for i, item in enumerate(file_tree[:5]): # Print the first 5 items
            print(f"{i+1}. {item}")
        print("------")
        
        # Example of what one item might look like:
        # {'path': 'src/kit/repository.py', 'is_dir': False, 'name': 'repository.py', 'size': 14261}
    else:
        print("File tree is empty or could not be retrieved.")
    ```

2.  **Understanding the Output**

    The `get_file_tree()` method returns a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a file or directory and typically includes:
    *   `'path'`: The relative path from the repository root.
    *   `'is_dir'`: `True` if it's a directory, `False` if it's a file.
    *   `'name'`: The base name of the file or directory.
    *   `'size'`: The size in bytes (often 0 for directories in this view).

    This method respects rules defined in `.gitignore` (by default) and gives you a snapshot of the files `kit` is aware of.

</Steps>

## Searching for Text in Files

`kit` allows you to perform text-based searches across your repository, similar to using `grep`. This is handled by the `repo.search_text()` method.

<Steps>

1.  **Perform a Search (Default: All Files)**

    Let's search for the term "app". By default, `search_text` now looks in all files (`*`).

    ```python
    # Assuming 'repo' is your Repository instance

    print("\n--- Searching for Text ---")
    query_text = "app"
    # The default file_pattern is now "*", so it searches all files
    search_results_all = repo.search_text(query=query_text)

    if search_results_all:
        print(f"Found {len(search_results_all)} occurrences of '{query_text}' in all files.")
        print("\nFirst 3 search results (all files):")
        for i, result in enumerate(search_results_all[:3]):
            print(f"\nResult {i+1}:")
            print(f"  File: {result.get('file')}")
            print(f"  Line Number (0-indexed): {result.get('line_number')}") 
            print(f"  Line Content: {result.get('line', '').strip()}")
    else:
        print(f"No occurrences of '{query_text}' found in any files.")
    print("------")
    ```

2.  **Search in Specific File Types**

    You can still specify a `file_pattern` to search in specific file types. For example, to search for "Repository" only in Python (`*.py`) files:

    ```python
    query_repo = "Repository"
    pattern_py = "*.py"
    print(f"\nSearching for '{query_repo}' in '{pattern_py}' files...")
    repo_py_results = repo.search_text(query=query_repo, file_pattern=pattern_py)

    if repo_py_results:
        print(f"Found {len(repo_py_results)} occurrences of '{query_repo}' in Python files.")
        print("First result (Python files):")
        first_py_result = repo_py_results[0]
        print(f"  File: {first_py_result.get('file')}")
        print(f"  Line Number (0-indexed): {first_py_result.get('line_number')}")
        print(f"  Line Content: {first_py_result.get('line', '').strip()}")
    else:
        print(f"No occurrences of '{query_repo}' found in '{pattern_py}' files.")
    print("------")
    ```

3.  **Understanding the Output**

    `search_text()` returns a list of dictionaries, each representing a match. Key fields include:
    *   `'file'`: The path to the file where the match was found.
    *   `'line_number'`: The (often 0-indexed) line number of the match.
    *   `'line'`: The full content of the line containing the match.
    *   `'context_before'` and `'context_after'`: Lists for lines before/after the match (may be empty depending on search configuration).

    Keep in mind this is a literal text search and is case-sensitive by default. It will find the query string as a substring anywhere it appears (e.g., "app" within "mapper" or "happy").

</Steps>

## Workflow: Get First File's Content

A common task is to list files, select one, and then retrieve its contents. Here's a simple workflow to get the content of the first file listed by `get_file_tree()`.

<Steps>

1.  **Get File Tree, Pick First File, and Get Content**

    This script finds the first item in the `file_tree` that is a file (not a directory) and prints a snippet of its content.

    ```python
    # Assuming 'repo' is your Repository instance

    print("\n--- Workflow: Get First *File's* Content ---")

    # 1. List all items
    file_tree = repo.get_file_tree()

    first_file_path = None
    if file_tree:
        # 2. Find the path of the first actual file in the tree
        for item in file_tree:
            if not item.get('is_dir', False): # Make sure it's a file
                first_file_path = item['path']
                break # Stop once we've found the first file

    if not first_file_path:
        print("No actual files (non-directories) found in the repository.")
    else:
        print(f"\nPicking the first *file* found in the tree: {first_file_path}")

        # 3. Get its content
        print(f"Attempting to read content from: {first_file_path}")
        try:
            content = repo.get_file_content(first_file_path)
            print(f"\n--- Content of {first_file_path} (first 300 chars) ---")
            print(content[:300] + "..." if len(content) > 300 else content)
            print(f"------ End of {first_file_path} snippet ------")
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print(f"Error: File not found at '{first_file_path}'.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
    print("------")
    ```

2.  **Example Output**

    If the first file in your repository is `LICENSE`, the output might look like:

    ```text
    --- Workflow: Get First *File's* Content ---

    Picking the first *file* found in the tree: LICENSE
    Attempting to read content from: LICENSE

    --- Content of LICENSE (first 300 chars) ---
    MIT License

    Copyright (c) 2024 Cased

    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
    of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
    in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights

    ------ End of LICENSE snippet ------
    ------
    ```

    This demonstrates successfully using `get_file_tree()` to discover a file and `get_file_content()` to read it.

</Steps>

### Chunking File Content by Lines (`repo.chunk_file_by_lines()`)

The `Repository` class provides a method to break down a file's content into smaller string chunks based on a target maximum number of lines. This is useful for preprocessing text for Large Language Models (LLMs) or other tools that have input size limits.

The method signature is: `repo.chunk_file_by_lines(file_path: str, max_lines: int = 50) -> List[str]`

-   `file_path`: The relative path to the file within the repository.
-   `max_lines`: The desired maximum number of lines for each chunk. The actual number of lines in a chunk might vary slightly as the method attempts to find reasonable break points.
-   It returns a list of strings, where each string is a content chunk.

**Example 1: Chunking a small file (e.g., `LICENSE`)**

If the file is smaller than `max_lines`, it will be returned as a single chunk.

```python
license_path = "LICENSE"
license_chunks = repo.chunk_file_by_lines(license_path)

print(f"Number of chunks for {license_path}: {len(license_chunks)}")
if license_chunks:
    print(f"Content of the first chunk (first 50 chars):\n---\n{license_chunks[0][:50]}...\n---")
```

**Expected Output (for `LICENSE`):**

```text
Number of chunks for LICENSE: 1
Content of the first chunk (first 50 chars):
---
MIT License

Copyright (c) 2024 Cased

Permiss...
---
```

**Example 2: Chunking a larger file (e.g., `src/kit/repository.py`)**

For larger files, the content will be split into multiple string chunks.

```python
repo_py_path = "src/kit/repository.py"
repo_py_chunks = repo.chunk_file_by_lines(repo_py_path, max_lines=50)

print(f"\nNumber of chunks for {repo_py_path} (with max_lines=50): {len(repo_py_chunks)}")

for i, chunk_content in enumerate(repo_py_chunks[:2]):
    print(f"\n--- Chunk {i+1} for {repo_py_path} ---")
    print(f"  Approx. line count: {len(chunk_content.splitlines())}")
    print(f"  Content (first 100 chars):\n  \"\"\"\n{chunk_content[:100]}...\n  \"\"\"")
```

**Expected Output (for `src/kit/repository.py`, showing 2 of 7 chunks):**

```text
Number of chunks for src/kit/repository.py (with max_lines=50): 7

--- Chunk 1 for src/kit/repository.py ---
  Approx. line count: 48
  Content (first 100 chars):
  """
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, Dict, List, Optional, Unio...
  """

--- Chunk 2 for src/kit/repository.py ---
  Approx. line count: 20 
  Content (first 100 chars):
  """
                    # If not on a branch (detached HEAD), get commit SHA
                    sha_cmd = ["git", "rev...
  """
```
*(Note: Actual line counts per chunk may vary slightly based on how the chunker splits the content. The second chunk from your output had fewer lines than the first.)*

### Chunking File Content by Symbols (`repo.chunk_file_by_symbols()`)

A more semantically aware way to chunk files is by symbols. This method uses `kit`'s understanding of code structure to break the file into chunks that correspond to whole symbols like functions, classes, or methods. Each chunk represents a meaningful structural unit of the code.

The method signature is: `repo.chunk_file_by_symbols(file_path: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]`

-   `file_path`: The relative path to the file within the repository.
-   It returns a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents one symbol-chunk and contains details like the symbol's `name`, `type`, `code` content, and `start_line`/`end_line` numbers.

**Example: Chunking `src/kit/tree_sitter_symbol_extractor.py` by symbols**

```python
extractor_path = "src/kit/tree_sitter_symbol_extractor.py"
symbol_chunks = repo.chunk_file_by_symbols(file_path=extractor_path)

print(f"Successfully chunked '{extractor_path}' into {len(symbol_chunks)} symbol-based chunks.")

for i, chunk_dict in enumerate(symbol_chunks[:2]): # Show first 2 symbol chunks
    print(f"\n--- Symbol Chunk {i+1} ---")
    symbol_name = chunk_dict.get('name', 'N/A')
    symbol_type = chunk_dict.get('type', 'N/A')
    start_line = chunk_dict.get('start_line', 'N/A')
    end_line = chunk_dict.get('end_line', 'N/A')
    code_content = chunk_dict.get('code', '')
    
    print(f"  Symbol Name: {symbol_name}")
    print(f"  Symbol Type: {symbol_type}")
    print(f"  Start Line (0-indexed): {start_line}")
    print(f"  End Line (0-indexed): {end_line}")
    print(f"  Line Count of code: {len(code_content.splitlines())}")
    print(f"  Content (first 150 chars of code):\n  \"\"\"\n{code_content[:150]}...\n  \"\"\"")
```

**Expected Output (for `src/kit/tree_sitter_symbol_extractor.py`, showing 2 of 4 chunks):**

```text
Successfully chunked 'src/kit/tree_sitter_symbol_extractor.py' into 4 symbol-based chunks.

--- Symbol Chunk 1 ---
  Symbol Name: TreeSitterSymbolExtractor
  Symbol Type: class
  Start Line (0-indexed): 28
  End Line (0-indexed): 197
  Line Count of code: 170
  Content (first 150 chars of code):
  """

  """

--- Symbol Chunk 2 ---
  Symbol Name: get_parser

  Content (first 150 chars of code):

        if ext not in cls._parsers:
         ...
  """
```

This provides a more structured way to access and process individual components of a code file.

We'll add more examples here as we try them out.

*(This document will be updated as we explore more features.)*
