title: LLM Best Practices
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Providing the right context to a Large Language Model (LLM) is critical for getting accurate and relevant results when building AI developer tools with `kit`. This guide outlines best practices for assembling context using `kit` features.

### 1. File Tree (`repo.get_file_tree`)

*   **Context:** Provides the overall structure of the repository or specific directories.
*   **Use Cases:** Understanding project layout, locating relevant modules.
*   **Prompting Tip:** Include the file tree when asking the LLM about high-level architecture or where to find specific functionality.

```yaml
# Example Context Block
Repository File Tree (partial):
src/
  __init__.py
  core/
    repo.py
    search.py
  utils/
    parsing.py
tests/
  test_repo.py
README.md
```

<Aside type="caution">
  Use depth limits or filtering for large projects to avoid overwhelming the LLM.
</Aside>

### 2. Symbols (`repo.get_symbols`)

*   **Context:** Lists functions, classes, variables, etc., within specified files.
*   **Use Cases:** Understanding the code within a file, finding specific definitions, providing context for code generation/modification tasks.
*   **Prompting Tip:** Clearly label the file path associated with the symbols.

```yaml
# Example Context Block
Symbols in src/core/repo.py:
- class Repo:
  - def __init__(self, path):
  - def get_symbols(self, file_paths):
  - def search_semantic(self, query):
- function _validate_path(path):
```

<Aside type="note">
  Filter symbols to relevant files/modules when possible.
</Aside>

### 3. Code Snippets (via Symbols or `get_file_content`)

*   **Context:** The actual source code of specific functions, classes, or entire files.
*   **Use Cases:** Detailed code review, bug finding, explanation, modification.
*   **Prompting Tip:** Provide the code for symbols identified as relevant by other context methods (e.g., symbols mentioned in a diff, search results).

```python
# Example Context Block
Code for Repo.search_semantic in src/core/repo.py:

def search_semantic(self, query):
    # ... implementation ...
    pass
```

<Aside type="note">
  Clearly identify chunks in the prompt and prefer symbol-based chunking over line-based chunking when appropriate.
</Aside>

### 4. Text Search Results (`repo.search_text`)

*   **Context:** Lines of code matching a specific text query.
*   **Use Cases:** Finding specific variable names, API calls, error messages.
*   **Prompting Tip:** Include the search query and clearly label the results.

```yaml
# Example Context Block
Text search results for "database connection":
- src/db/connect.py:15: conn = connect_database()
- src/config.py:8: DATABASE_URL = "..."
```

<Aside type="note">
  Clearly specify the search query used to generate the results.
</Aside>

### 5. Symbol Usages (`repo.find_symbol_usages`)

*   **Context:** Where a specific symbol (function, class) is used or called throughout the codebase. This method finds definitions and textual occurrences.
*   **Use Cases:** Understanding the impact of changing a function, finding examples of how an API is used, basic dependency analysis.
*   **Prompting Tip:** Specify the symbol whose usages are being listed.

```yaml
# Example Context Block
Usages of function connect_database (defined in src/db/connect.py):
- src/app.py:50: db_conn = connect_database()
- tests/test_db.py:12: mock_connect = mock(connect_database)
```

<Aside type="note">
  Clearly indicate the symbol whose usages are being shown.
</Aside>

### 6. Semantic Search Results (`repo.search_semantic`)

*   **Context:** Code chunks semantically similar to a natural language query.
*   **Use Cases:** Finding code related to a concept (e.g., "user authentication logic"), exploring related functionality.
*   **Prompting Tip:** Include the semantic query and label the results clearly.

```
# Example Context Block
Semantic search results for "user login handling":
- Chunk from src/auth/login.py (lines 25-40):
    def handle_login(username, password):
        # ... validation logic ...
  
- Chunk from src/models/user.py (lines 10-15):
    class User:
        # ... attributes ...
```

<Aside type="note">
  Indicate that the results are from a semantic search, as the matches might not be exact text matches.
</Aside>

### 7. Diff Content

*   **Context:** The specific lines added, removed, or modified in a changeset (e.g., a Git diff).
*   **Use Cases:** Code review, understanding specific changes in a PR or commit.
*   **Prompting Tip:** Clearly mark the diff section in the context.

```diff
# Example Context Block
Code Diff:
--- a/src/utils/parsing.py
+++ b/src/utils/parsing.py
@@ -10,5 +10,6 @@
 def parse_data(raw_data):
     # Extended parsing logic
+    data = preprocess(raw_data)
     return json.loads(data)

```

<Aside type="note">
  Pair this context with specific line numbers for targeted analysis.
</Aside>

### 8. Vector Search Results (`repo.search_vectors`)

*   **Context:** Code chunks similar to a given vector representation.
*   **Use Cases:** Finding code related to a concept (e.g., "user authentication logic"), exploring related functionality.
*   **Prompting Tip:** Include the vector query and label the results clearly.

```
# Example Context Block
Vector search results for "user login handling":
- Chunk from src/auth/login.py (lines 25-40):
    def handle_login(username, password):
        # ... validation logic ...

- Chunk from src/models/user.py (lines 10-15):
    class User:
        # ... attributes ...
```

<Aside type="note">
  Indicate that the results are from a vector search, as the matches might not be exact text matches.
</Aside>
