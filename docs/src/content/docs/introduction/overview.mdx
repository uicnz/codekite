## codekite: Code Intelligence Toolkit

A modular, production-grade toolkit for codebase mapping, symbol extraction, code search, and LLM-powered developer workflows. Supports multi-language codebases via `tree-sitter`.

`codekite` features a "mid-level API" to build your own custom tools, applications, agents, and workflows: easily build code review bots, semantic code search, documentation generators, and more.

`codekite` is **free and open source** with a permissive MIT license. Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/shaneholloman/codekite).

## Installation

### Install from PyPI

```sh
# Basic installation, it's currently `codekite` on pypi
pip install codekite

# With OpenAI support
pip install codekite[openai]

# With all features (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, vector search, API)
pip install codekite[all]
```

### Install from Source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/shaneholloman/codekite.git
cd codekite
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

## Why Use codekite?

`codekite` helps with:

*   **Unifying Code Access:** Provides a single, consistent `Repository` object to interact with files, symbols, and search across diverse codebases, regardless of language.
*   **Deep Code Understanding:** Leverages `tree-sitter` for accurate, language-specific parsing, enabling reliable symbol extraction and structural analysis across an entire codebase.
*   **Bridging Code and LLMs:** Offers tools specifically designed to chunk code effectively and retrieve relevant context for large language models, powering smarter AI developer tools.

## Core Philosophy

`codekite` aims to be a **toolkit** for building applications, agents, and workflows.
It handles the low-level parsing and indexing complexity, and allows you to adapt these components to your specific needs.

We believe the building blocks for code intelligence and LLM workflows for developer tools should be free and open source,
so you can build amazing products and experiences.
