```bash
git clone https://github.com/cased/kit.git
cd kit
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

Now, you can use kit!
kit ships with a demonstration repository at `tests/fixtures/` you can use to get started. 

Try this simple Python script (e.g., save as `test_kit.py` in the `kit` directory you cloned):

```python
import kit
import os

# Path to the demo repository
repo_path = "tests/fixtures/realistic_repo"

print(f"Loading repository at: {repo_path}")
# Ensure you have cloned the 'kit' repository and are in its root directory
# for this relative path to work correctly.
repo = kit.Repository(repo_path)

# Print the first 5 Python files found in the demo repo
print("\nFound Python files in the demo repo (first 5):")
count = 0
for file in repo.files('*.py'):
    print(f"- {file.path}")
    count += 1
    if count >= 5:
        break

if count == 0:
    print("No Python files found in the demo repository.")

# Extract symbols from a specific file in the demo repo (e.g., app.py)
target_file = 'app.py'
print(f"\nExtracting symbols from {target_file} in the demo repo (first 5):")
try:
    symbols = repo.extract_symbols(target_file)
    if symbols:
        for i, symbol in enumerate(symbols):
            print(f"- {symbol.name} ({symbol.kind}) at line {symbol.range.start.line}")
            if i >= 4:
                break
    else:
        print(f"No symbols found or file not parseable: {target_file}")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"File not found: {target_file}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred extracting symbols: {e}")

```

Run it with `python test_kit.py`.
