## Map any codebase

Welcome to **kit** - the Python toolkit from [Shane Holloman](https://shaneholloman.dev) for building LLM-powered developer tools and workflows. kit shines for getting \*\*precise, accurate, and relevant context\*\* to LLMs. Use kit to build code reviewers, code generators and graphs, even full-fledged coding assistants: all enriched with the right code context. MIT-licensed on \[GitHub\](https://github.com/shaneholloman/codekit).

## Map any codebase

Get a structured view with file trees, language-aware symbol extraction (powered by tree-sitter), and dependency insights.

## Support for multiple search methods

Mix and match to optimize for speed, accuracy, and use case. Combine fast text search with semantic vector search to find relevant code snippets instantly.

## Fine-grained docstring context

Use generated docstrings to find code snippets, answer questions, and improve code generation based on summarized content.

## Build AI Workflows

Leverage ready-made utilities for code chunking, context retrieval, and interacting with LLMs.
