title: Adding New Languages
---

- To add a new language:
  1. Add a tree-sitter grammar and build it (see [tree-sitter docs](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/creating-parsers)).
  2. Add a `queries/<lang>/tags.scm` file with queries for symbols you want to extract.
  3. Add the file extension to `TreeSitterSymbolExtractor.LANGUAGES`.
  4. Write/expand tests for the new language.

**Why?**
- This approach lets you support any language with a tree-sitter grammarâ€”no need to change core logic.
- `tags.scm` queries make symbol extraction flexible and community-driven.
